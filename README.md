## Training Guide

### Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/castorini/howl && cd howl`

2. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) by following your platform-specific instructions.

3. Install PyAudio and its dependencies through your distribution's package system.

4. `pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements_training.txt` (some apt packages might need to be installed)

5. `./download_mfa.sh` to setup montreal forced aligner (MFA) for dataset generation

### Preparing a Dataset

Generating a dataset for a custom wakeword requires three steps:
1. Generating raw audio dataset that howl can load from open datasets
2. Generate orthographic transcription alignments for each audio file.
3. Attach the alignment to the raw audio dataset generated in step 1.

Having said that we recommend [Common Voice dataset](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/) for the open audio datasets and [Montreal Forced Aligner](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) (MFA) for the transcription alignment.
Downloading MFA can be achieved simply running `download_mfa.sh` script. Along with the aligner, the script will download necessary [English pronunciation dictionary](http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cmusphinx/code/trunk/cmudict/cmudict-0.7b).

Once they are ready, a dataset can be generated using the following script.
```bash
./generate_dataset.sh <common voice dataset path> <underscore separated wakeword (e.g. hey_fire_fox)> <inference sequence (e.g. [0,1,2])> <(Optional) "true" to skip negative dataset generation>
```

For detailed explanation, please refer to [How to generate a dataset for custom wakeword](https://github.com/castorini/howl/tree/master/howl/dataset)

### Training and Running a Model

1. Source the relevant environment variables for training the `res8` model: `source envs/res8.env`.
2. Train the model: `python -m training.run.train -i datasets/fire-positive datasets/fire-negative datasets/fire-stitched --model res8 --workspace workspaces/fire-res8`.
3. For the CLI demo, run `python -m training.run.demo --model res8 --workspace workspaces/fire-res8`.

`train_model.sh` is also available which encaspulates individual command into a single bash script

```bash
./train_model.sh <env file path (e.g. envs/res8.env)> <model type (e.g. res8)> <workspace path (e.g. workspaces/fire-res8)> <dataset1 (e.g. datasets/fire-positive)> <dataset2 (e.g. datasets/fire-negative)> ...
```

### Pretrained Models

[howl-models](https://github.com/castorini/howl-models) contains workspaces with pretrained models

To get the latest models, simply run `git submodule update --init --recursive`

- [hey firefox](https://github.com/castorini/howl-models/tree/master/howl/hey-fire-fox)

```bash
VOCAB='["hey","fire","fox"]' INFERENCE_SEQUENCE=[0,1,2] INFERENCE_THRESHOLD=0 NUM_MELS=40 MAX_WINDOW_SIZE_SECONDS=0.5 python -m training.run.demo --model res8 --workspace howl-models/howl/hey-fire-fox
```

## Installing Howl using pip

1. Install PyAudio and [PyTorch 1.5+](https://pytorch.org) through your distribution's package system.

2. Install Howl using `pip`

```
pip install howl
```

3. To immediately use a pre-trained Howl model for inference, we provide the `client` API. The following example (also found under `examples/hey_fire_fox.py`) loads the "hey_fire_fox" pretrained model with a simple callback and starts the inference client.

```
from howl.client import HowlClient

def hello_callback(detected_words):
    print("Detected: {}".format(detected_words))

client = HowlClient()
client.from_pretrained("hey_fire_fox", force_reload=False)
client.add_listener(hello_callback)
client.start().join()
```

## Reproducing Paper Results

First, follow the installation instructions in the quickstart guide.

### Google Speech Commands

1. Download [the Google Speech Commands dataset](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/launching-speech-commands-dataset.html) and extract it.
2. Source the appropriate environment variables: `source envs/res8.env`
3. Set the dataset path to the root folder of the Speech Commands dataset: `export DATASET_PATH=/path/to/dataset`
4. Train the `res8` model: `NUM_EPOCHS=20 MAX_WINDOW_SIZE_SECONDS=1 VOCAB='["yes","no","up","down","left","right","on","off","stop","go"]' BATCH_SIZE=64 LR_DECAY=0.8 LEARNING_RATE=0.01 python -m training.run.pretrain_gsc --model res8`

### Hey Firefox

1. Download [the Hey Firefox corpus](https://nlp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/hey-ff-data.zip), licensed under CC0, and extract it.
2. Download [our noise dataset](https://nlp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/hey-ff-noise.zip), built from Microsoft SNSD and MUSAN, and extract it.
3. Source the appropriate environment variables: `source envs/res8.env`
4. Set the noise dataset path to the root folder: `export NOISE_DATASET_PATH=/path/to/snsd`
5. Set the firefox dataset path to the root folder: `export DATASET_PATH=/path/to/hey_firefox`
6. Train the model: `LR_DECAY=0.98 VOCAB='["hey","fire","fox"]' USE_NOISE_DATASET=True BATCH_SIZE=16 INFERENCE_THRESHOLD=0 NUM_EPOCHS=300 NUM_MELS=40 INFERENCE_SEQUENCE=[0,1,2] MAX_WINDOW_SIZE_SECONDS=0.5 python -m training.run.train --model res8 --workspace workspaces/hey-ff-res8`

### Hey Snips

1. Download [hey snips dataset](https://github.com/sonos/keyword-spotting-research-datasets)
2. Process the dataset to a format howl can load

```bash
VOCAB='["hey","snips"]' INFERENCE_SEQUENCE=[0,1] DATASET_PATH=datasets/hey-snips python -m training.run.deprecated.create_raw_dataset --dataset-loader-type 'hey-snips' -i ~/path/to/hey_snips_dataset
```

3. Generate some mock alignment for the dataset, where we don't care about alignment:

```bash
python -m training.run.attach_alignment \
  --input-raw-audio-dataset datasets/hey-snips \
  --token-type word \
  --alignment-type stub
```

4. Use MFA to generate alignment for the dataset set:

mfa_align datasets/hey-snips/audio eng.dict pretrained_models/english.zip datasets/hey-snips/alignments
```

5. Attach the MFA alignment to the dataset:

```bash
python -m training.run.attach_alignment \
  --input-raw-audio-dataset datasets/hey-snips \
  --token-type word \
  --alignment-type mfa \
  --alignments-path datasets/hey-snips/alignments
```

6. Source the appropriate environment variables: `source envs/res8.env`
7. Set the noise dataset path to the root folder: `export NOISE_DATASET_PATH=/path/to/snsd`
8. Set the noise dataset path to the root folder: `export DATASET_PATH=/path/to/hey-snips`
9. Train the model: `LR_DECAY=0.98 VOCAB='["hey","snips"]' USE_NOISE_DATASET=True BATCH_SIZE=16 INFERENCE_THRESHOLD=0 NUM_EPOCHS=300 NUM_MELS=40 INFERENCE_SEQUENCE=[0,1] MAX_WINDOW_SIZE_SECONDS=0.5 python -m training.run.train --model res8 --workspace workspaces/hey-snips-res8`

### Generating dataset for Mycroft-precise

howl also provides a script for transforming howl dataset to [mycroft-precise](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-precise) dataset
```bash
VOCAB='["hey","fire","fox"]' INFERENCE_SEQUENCE=[0,1,2] python -m training.run.generate_precise_dataset --dataset-path /path/to/howl_dataset
```

## Experiments

To verify the correctness of our implementation, we first train and evaluate our models on the Google Speech Commands dataset, for which there exists many known results. Next, we curate a wake word detection datasets and report our resulting model quality.

For both experiments, we generate reports in excel format. [experiments](https://github.com/castorini/howl/tree/master/experiments) folder includes sample outputs from the for each experiment and corresponding workspaces can be found [here](https://github.com/castorini/howl-models/tree/master/howl/experiments)

### commands_recognition

For command recognition, we train the four different models (res8, LSTM, LAS encoder, MobileNetv2) to detect twelve different keywords: “yes”, “no”, “up”, “down”, “left”, “right”, “on”, “off”, “stop”, “go”, unknown, or silence.

```bash
python -m training.run.eval_commands_recognition --num_iterations n --dataset_path < path_to_gsc_datasets >
```

### word_detection

In this experiment, we train our best commands recognition model, res8, for `hey firefox` and `hey snips` and evaluate them with different threashold.

Two different performance reports are generated, one with the clean audio and one with audios with noise

```bash
python -m training.run.eval_wake_word_detection --num_models n --hop_size < number between 0 and 1 > --exp_type < hey_firefox | hey_snips > --dataset_path "x" --noiseset_path "y"
```

We also provide a script for generating ROC curve. `exp_timestamp` can be found from the reports generated from previous command

```bash
python -m training.run.generate_roc --exp_timestamp < experiment timestamp > --exp_type < hey_firefox | hey_snips >
```
